Package basic-mode provides a major mode for editing BASIC code in GNU Emacs.
Features include syntax highlighting and indentation, as well as support for
auto-numbering and renumering of code lines.


## Installation

The recommended way to install basic-mode is from [MELPA](https://melpa.org).

To install manually, place basic-mode.el in your load-path, and add the
following lines of code to your init file:

```elisp
(autoload 'basic-mode "basic-mode" "Major mode for editing BASIC code." t)
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.bas\\'" . basic-mode))
```


## Usage


### Formatting Code

TAB indents the current line of BASIC code, including line numbers if available.
If the region is active, TAB indents all lines in the region.

_C-c C-f_ formats the entire buffer; indents all lines, and removes any extra
whitespace. If the region is active, _C-c C-f_ formats all lines in the region.


### Line Numbers

For classic BASIC, basic-mode provides several functions to manage line numbers.
Customize variables basic-auto-number and basic-line-number-cols to your liking
to turn on line numbers.

With line numbers turned on, RET will start new lines with a fresh line number.
The line number increment is defined by variable basic-auto-number. _C-c C-r_
will renumber all lines in the entire buffer, including any jumps in the code.
The line number increment used when renumbering is defined by variable
basic-renumber-increment. If the region is active, _C-c C-r_ renumbers all lines
in the region instead.

With line numbers turned on, _C-c C-f_ will also respect line numbers, and the
value configured in basic-line-number-cols while formatting.


### Navigation

Package basic-mode also provides additional functionality to navigate in the
source code. _M-._ will find and move to the line number, label, or variable at
point, and _M-,_ will move back again. For more information, see function
xref-find-definitions.
